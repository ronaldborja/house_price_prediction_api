# Development of a Fullstack App: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the development of a fullstack web application that implements a vectorized Linear Regression algorithm to predict house prices. The app combines robust backend development, an interactive frontend interface, and data analysis techniques to deliver predictions based on user input.

Project Features

    Machine Learning: Vectorized implementation of Linear Regression using NumPy for efficient computations.
    Data Analysis: Analysis and visualization of housing data using Pandas and Matplotlib.
    Backend Development: A RESTful API developed using FastAPI.
    Frontend Development: A user-friendly interface developed with React.
    Upcoming Features:
        Integration of Docker for containerization.
        Deployment on AWS for global accessibility.
